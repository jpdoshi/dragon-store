<h1 align="center">Dragon Store</h1>

Dragon Store is your gateway to transparent, libre and free open-source apps. It is exclusively made for power users to install mod apps easily.

The end goal of Dragon store is to provide apps to users in a safe and transparent way, directly from the source. I believe that users must know where they are getting the installer file and whether the source is legit or not. Dragon store use Repo-as-a-backend principle to let users download and install apps from latest release source.
